# vcfR 2.0.0.
There is currently no plan to release vcfR 2.0.0.
If and when this 'major' release occurs it will include changes that will break backward compatibility.
At the present, this is simply a to-do list for ideas to include in the next major release.

* `gzread` needs us to tell it a maximum number of bytes to read in, so we need to make an arbitrary guess.
I think I encountered a situation where 4-96 was not enough so I've bumped it to 16,384 B.
* Move 'FORMAT' column to its own slot. We can then cbind FORMAT and gt when passing to compiled code.
This may have been addressed at 64a308ba50b9119108e8946737460de5997b805b by adding `samples` to vcfR method `[`.
* In issue #92 (vcfR2genlight big data #92), JimWhiting91 has documented that `extract.gt()` could be greatly improved with multithreading. While he used `mclapply()` I do not feel this is the best solution because it does not work on Windows. I think a better solution would be [RCppParallel](https://rcppcore.github.io/RcppParallel/) because this should work on all CRAN platforms.

# vcfR 1.14.0
Released on CRAN 202X-XX-XX
* Compile time 'nodiscard' attribute
* vcfR_to_tidy handles no INFO in meta

# vcfR 1.13.0
Released on CRAN 2022-07-16
* Added ```vcfR2hapmap()``` to convert data for use in GAPIT

# vcfR 1.12.0
Released on CRAN 2020-09-01
* Added ```PKGTYPE: both``` to appveyor.yml so Windows packages can be built from source
* Omitted ```configure``` file that unnecessarily tried to invoke checkbashisms
* Incorporated help from https://stackoverflow.com/a/62721142 to use checkbashisms when checking on Debian flavors of Linux (ended up omitting this change but left this here to document it and the link)

# vcfR 1.11.0
Released on CRAN 2020-06-05
* Now compatible with R 4.0.0 and dplyr 1.0.0

# vcfR 1.10.0
Released on CRAN 2020-02-06
* Handled deprecated "dplyr::verb_" function in vcfR2tidy
* Omitted unused elipses from proc.chromR()

# vcfR 1.9.0
Released on CRAN 2020-01-10
* Changed class(x) == "matrix" to inherited(x, "matrix")
* Changed license from `GPL` to `GPL-3` (#144).
* `extract.haps()` reports the correct number of variants processed when verbose.
* The square brackets ([]) handle @gt slots with no samples.
* `vcfR2loci()` now has the option `return.alleles = FALSE`.
* `vcfR2genind()` now has the option `retrun.alleles = FALSE`.
* Error handling code moved into the C++ functions called by read.vcfR so that errors are thrown earlier when reading a VCF. read.vcfR no longer checks that a file is readable first, which solves issues sometimes seen with shared files. (Issue #109, reported and fixed by @NikNakk).
* `extract.haps()` did not include the parameter `return.alleles = TRUE` in it's call to `extract.gt()` in the haploid branch of the function. This parameter has now been added. This also affects `vcfR2DNAbin()` which calls this function.
* `vcfR2genlight()` includes the parameter `...` to pass parameters to `adegenet::df2genind()`.
* `is.indel()` returns logical vector to identify indels.
* gt.to.popsum now handles genotypes that include some, but not all, missing alleles.

# vcfR 1.8.0
Released on CRAN 2018-04-17
* Attempted to address CRAN's 'Note: break used in wrong context: no loop is visible' issue.
* `.vcf_stats_gz()` reports number of elements in header as well as the file's last line. This is used by `read.vcfR()` to check for poorly formed files.
* `show` method for vcfR now queries @fix instead of @gt.
* `check_keys()` checks key definitions in the meta section to make sure they are unique.
* `freq_peak_plot()` has parameter `posUnits` to adjust units of scatterplot.
* `vcfR2migrate()` manual discusses Unix and Windows line endings.

* `extract.indels()` ignores GATK's <NON_REF>.
* Added support for chromR objects with no gt slot to `proc.chromR()`.

* Moved `pinfsc50.png` to tools.
* Added `samples` parameter to vcfR method `[`.
* Deprecated the parameters 'chrom.s' and 'chrom.e' of 'chromo()', please use 'xlim' instead.
* Added `length()` method for chromR objects.
* `[` method throws warning if FORMAT is omitted.
* `plot()` for signature 'chromR' handles INFO column when its all NA.
* `create.chrom()` subsets to first chromosome when more than one is provided.
* adegenet::nLoc(NULL) appears to generate an error when converting data types.


# vcfR 1.4.0
Released on CRAN 2017-01-07.

* `masplit()` converts '.' to NA.

* `extract.gt()` no longer uses parameter `allele.sep()`. 
* Added more info to chromR show method.

  Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value(s) - write_vcf_body file initialization issue resolved.
