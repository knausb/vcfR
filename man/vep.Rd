Output from the \href{https://useast.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html}{VEP} may include values with multiple equals signs.
This does not appear to conform with the VCF specification (at the time of writing this \href{http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/}{VCF v4.3}).
But it appears fairly easy to accomodate.
This example data can be used to make unit tests to validate functionality.
